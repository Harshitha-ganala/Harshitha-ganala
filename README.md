Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is GANALA MANASA SRI HARSHITHA, 

I have completed my graduation in Electronics and Communication Engineering at Jawaharlal Nehru Technological university, Vizianagaram. The intricate dance of millions of components within a tiny space inspires my passion for coding and design in electronics.

âœ¨Technical Proficiencies Include:

ðŸ”¹HDL: Verilog

ðŸ”¹HVL: SystemVerilog

ðŸ”¹VERIFICATION METHODOLOGY: Constraint Random Coverage Driven-Verification | Assertion Based Verification - SVA

ðŸ”¹TB Methodology: UVM( Universal Verification Methodology)

ðŸ”¹EDA TOOLS:  Xilinx ISE 14.7, Mentor Graphics-Questasim, Modelsim

ðŸ”¹PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES: C[Datatype Array | Pointers List Memory Allocation | Functions Queues and stacks] || C++ [Oops Concepts, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Abstraction]

ðŸ”¹OPERATING SYSTEMS:Linux, Windows

ðŸ”¹CORE SKILLS: [RTL Coding using Synthesizable constructs of Verilog | FSM based design Simulation | CMOS Fundamentals Code Coverage | Functional Coverage |Synthesis | Static Timing Analysis | Assertion Based Verification using System Verilog Assertions]
